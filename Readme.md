Hi, This Repo is my notes about RabbitMQ.

Generally, this repo is based on [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials) tutorial and the documentation.

Make sure you already install [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) on your machine.

If you prefer using docker-compose, you can find the docker-compose file in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

Or If you only want to use RabbitMQ as a command line tool, you can use [rabbitmqctl](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html)
